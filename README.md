# My TitleCardMaker

This repository is a versioned configuration of the wonderful project [CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker).

It's set specifically for my machine, and can be run with a simple `docker compose up -d`, or `docker restart TitleCardMaker` once it's currently running.
If something is not working, make sure the volumes in the `docker-compose.yml` match the local filesystem and then rebuild the Docker container.
